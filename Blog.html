      Modern technology has given us plenty of benefits and conveniences, but with one major drawback: Most of us sit at a desk for eight (or more) hours a day, five days a week, most weeks of the year.

And unfortunately, the very thing that can make us productive, profitable, and successful employees for our company can also harm our health—maybe even permanently.

        Worldwide, having a 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. desk job is an inevitable part of the average adult’s life. A 20-year study from Cambridge University found that the sedentary lifestyle of an office worker often correlates with poor health, sometimes leading to early death.

Living a sedentary lifestyle puts a person at higher risk for conditions like cancer, type II diabetes, heart disease, dementia and stroke.

It’s recommended that an adult exercise for 150 minutes per week, but even taking small steps toward a more active lifestyle can pay off in the end. For example, just 15 minutes of moderate activity can provide significant cognitive boost. Long-term benefits of regular physical activity include weight loss, better sleep, improved mood and a more well-functioning immune system.

Oftentimes, a person working 40 hours per week doesn’t feel there’s enough time in the day for regular exercise. This is especially true when family obligations and other activities are part of the mix. Finding time for physical activity doesn’t have to be difficult. It’s all about using your time wisely.
Just because you work at a desk for eight hours a day doesn’t mean you have to go home and sit in front of the television for another eight hours. Find ways to work active time into your life outside of work. Take a group exercise class, hit the gym early in the morning, or go for a walk with your family in the evening.

Even if you’re healthy, spending all day sitting isn’t good for your health. But, with some planning, you can incorporate more movement into your daily life. Some office environments encourage standing at your desk with special desks that allow you to either sit or stand. If your desk doesn’t, don’t be discouraged. Stand when you can.

    Regular exercise and physical activity increase muscle strength, bone density, flexibility, and stability. Physical fitness can reduce your risk for and resilience to accidental injuries, especially as you get older. For example, stronger muscles and better balance mean that you’re less likely to slip and fall, and stronger bones mean that your less likely to suffer bone injuries should you take a tumble.
    A sedentary lifestyle and a lack of physical activity can take a toll on a person’s body. Physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk for certain types of cancer, numerous chronic diseases, and mental health issues. Exercise, however, has been shown to improve mood and mental health, and provides numerous health benefits. Of course physical fitness also allows you to do things that you may not otherwise be able to do.
Encourage your family to be more active, and challenge yourself to meet daily or weekly physical activity goals. Play outdoor sports with the whole family, schedule time each day to go to the gym, or pick up healthy, active hobbies like hiking or cycling. National Physical Fitness and Sports Month is a great time to get more active, but don’t stop at the end of the month. Make exercise and physical activity a permanent part of your daily routine!
To put it simply, physical activity and exercise is important for everyone. Children, adolescents, and adults of all ages need regular physical activity. Physical activity promotes good health, and you should stay active throughout all stages of your life regardless of your body type or BMI.

Understanding the benefits of physical fitness and knowing how active you should be can help you maintain good health and improve your overall quality of life.
