               <h2>Stand Up for Your Health </h2> <br>
               <h3>Sitting is the new smoking!</h3>
               <p> Make a point to stand up and move around for at least 2-3 minutes every hour.<br><br>

                Quick tips: Set a reminder on your phone or computer to stand up and move around every hour. Use a standing or treadmill desk to encourage movement throughout the day.<br><br>
                
                Take short breaks to walk around the office or outside during lunch.<br><br>
                
                Incorporate stretching or light exercises into your work routine.<br><br>
                
                Make a habit of standing up and walking during phone calls.<br><br>
                
                Use a pedometer or fitness tracker to monitor your daily steps and aim to increase them.<br><br>
                
                Keep a water bottle nearby and refill it frequently to remind you to stand up.<br><br></p>

               <h2>Stay Hydrated</h2><br>
               <h3>Drink up to stay on top</h3>
               <p>Drink water regularly throughout the day: Set a reminder to drink water every hour or so, and make sure to drink a glass or two with each meal.<br><br>

                Carry a water bottle with you: Keep a refillable water bottle with you at all times, whether you're at work, running errands, or working out.<br><br>
                
                Eat water-rich foods: Fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, watermelon, and strawberries are high in water content and can help keep you hydrated.<br><br>
                
                Limit diuretics: Avoid beverages that can dehydrate you, such as alcohol and caffeine.<br><br>
                
                Check your urine color: If your urine is pale yellow, it's a sign that you're well-hydrated. If it's dark yellow or amber, you may need to drink more water.<br><br> </p>
